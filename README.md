# LPLS - Launchpad Lightshow

A Flutter project for creating and performing lightshows on different platforms with different Launchpads.

## Why?

Ableton Live is good enough but it's unable to perform lightshows on smartphones.

## Features

- Import/export (`.lpls`) and opening/saving (`.lpp`) projects.
- Creating/editing effects (`.lpe`).

## Launchpad Compability

Currently this software supports the following Launchpads:

- Launchpad Mini
- Launchpad mk2
- Launchpad Mini mk3 (at Legacy Mode)

### Entering Legacy Mode (Launchpad Mini mk3)

Please ensure you have latest firmware at your Launchpad.

- Hold "Session" button.
- When you'll see setting grid, release Session and press violet pad (third from bottom at last right column).
- You'll see "Legacy" string. You can skip it pressing at any button.
- Press "Session" button again or bottom right pad at grid.
- Now you're in Legacy Mode.
