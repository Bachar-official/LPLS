# LPLS - Launchpad Lightshow

A Flutter project for creating and performing lightshows on different platforms with different Launchpads.

## Why?

Ableton Live is good enough but it's unable to perform lightshows on smartphones. Also, there are no Ableton Live releases on Linux.

## Tested OS

- Windows
- Linux
- Android

## Features

- Import `.lpls` projects.
- Export `.lpls` projects (only on desktop).
- Opening/saving unpacked projects `.lpp` (only on desktop).
- Creating/editing effects `.lpe` (only on desktop).

## Launchpad Compability

Currently this software supports the following Launchpads:

- Launchpad Mini
- Launchpad mk2
- Launchpad Mini mk3 (at Legacy Mode)

### Entering Legacy Mode (Launchpad Mini mk3)

Please ensure you have latest firmware at your Launchpad.

- Hold "Session" button.
- When you'll see setting grid, release Session and press violet pad (third from bottom at last right column).
- You'll see "Legacy" string. You can skip it pressing at any button.
- Press "Session" button again or bottom right pad at grid.
- Now you're in Legacy Mode.
